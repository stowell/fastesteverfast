<h1 id="fastest-ever-fast">Fastest Ever Fast</h1>
<p>After taking a handful of embarrassingly slow systems and making them run twice or a hundred times as fast, I told myself I had in fact quit the latency business and started writing some ostentatiously unoptimized code. &#39;We&#39;re all constrained by the speed of light,&#39; a definitely-grizzled-and-presumably-experienced dude once told me. He sounded tired. Not wanting to be taken in, to play the shell game, I stopped caring for a time.</p><p>But, having taken a break from vim, sampling profilers, daytime high-fructose corn syrup, I find myself pulled back in. The particular game that we keep playing, because latencies keep dropping in different places, often relatively dramatically, is doing as little IO as possible. What I want to capture here, on a single page, are tricks that come up repeatedly when trying to do the most with the fewest number of bytes possible.</p>
