<h1 id="fastest-ever-fast">Fastest Ever Fast</h1>
<p>After taking a handful of embarrassingly slow systems and making them twice or a hundred times less embarrassing, I told myself I had in fact quit the latency business and started writing some ostentatiously unoptimized code. &#39;We&#39;re all constrained by the speed of light,&#39; a definitely-grizzled-and-presumably-experienced dude once told me. He sounded tired. Not wanting to be taken in, to play the shell game, I stopped caring for a time.</p><p>But, having taken a break from vim, sampling profilers, daytime high-fructose corn syrup, it&#39;s pulling me back in. The particular game that we keep playing: doing as little IO as possible. What I want to capture here, on a single page, are tricks that come up repeatedly when trying to shuffle as few bytes as possible.</p><p><em>Italicized apology: I have spent most of my time in the world of milliseconds. If you measure microseconds, nanoseconds, clock cycles, or do anything that can be called &#39;real-time&#39; (not slow), then you will not find many surprises here.</em></p>
